# Domain-Specific-Agentic-RAG
• Built an Agentic RAG system using Gemini for domain-specific chat with multimodal retrieval, reranking, and LLM-based response generation. Used LangChain for agent workflow orchestration with memory, tool use, and prompt chaining.
• Implemented a local pipeline with Qdrant for fast retrieval of text, image, and table embeddings.
• Designed a multimodal ingestion pipeline to process PDFs using MiniLM and vision models for complete content understanding.
